# JS dependency demo

This is small demo of the new JS dependency functionality of `shadow-cljs`.


```
yarn
# or
npm install

# start server for convenience
shadow-cljs server

# compile once
shadow-cljs compile app

# if server or watch is running
open http://localhost:4001

# watch and recompile on change
shadow-cljs watch app

# release (optimize)
shadow-cljs release app
```
